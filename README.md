# Synchrysalis

Synchrysalis is an experimental **sound-art and creative coding project** that transforms live weather data into evolving, generative soundscapes.
It blends **ambient sound design, algorithmic composition, and data-driven interaction**, creating a bridge between natural phenomena and digital sound worlds.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🌦️ **Weather-driven sound generation** — translates live weather data (temperature, wind, humidity, etc.) into unique audio compositions.
- 🎛️ **Tone.js synth engines** — multiple layers of synthesis and effects for evolving textures.
- 📊 **Minimal visual interface** — clean weather data visuals paired with sound.
- 🔄 **Expandable data sources** — designed to incorporate other real-time or user-chosen data streams in the future.
- 📱 **Web-first, mobile-ready architecture** — built with React + TypeScript for easy transition to React Native.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Sound**: [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
- **Data**: Weather API (open-source/free providers)
- **Visualization**: D3.js (future expansion)
